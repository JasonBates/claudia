# Claudia - Project Instructions

## Displaying Images

To display an image inline, use the **Read tool** on the image file. The image will be shown automatically in the tool result.

```
Read /path/to/image.jpg
```

The image appears inline and can be clicked to view full-size (Escape to close).

## File Links

Standard markdown links are supported: `[text](url)`

MCP servers should output file references as markdown links with full paths:
```markdown
[daily-note.md](/Users/name/Obsidian/vault/daily-note.md)
```
