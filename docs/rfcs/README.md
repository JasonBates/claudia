# RFCs (Request for Comments)

This directory contains implementation plans, research documents, and design proposals for Claudia features.

## Documents

| Document | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [subagent-display-plan.md](subagent-display-plan.md) | Proposed | Implementation plan for subagent visualization (Option C) |
| [subagent-research.md](subagent-research.md) | Complete | Research on AI subagent tracking best practices |

## Purpose

RFCs serve as working documents that capture:
- **Research findings** before implementation
- **Design decisions** and trade-offs considered
- **Implementation plans** with phased delivery
- **Architecture decisions** that shape the codebase

Once implemented, key insights should be migrated to the main documentation (architecture.md, troubleshooting.md).

## Adding New RFCs

When planning a significant feature:
1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Document the problem, proposed solution, and alternatives considered
3. Include implementation phases and success criteria
4. Update this README with the new document
